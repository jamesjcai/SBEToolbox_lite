function k = dkernel(g, beta)
% Return diffusion kernel 
%
%   K = DKERNEL(G, BETA) return diffusion kernel of given diffusion
%   probability BETA. Diffusion kernel of a graph is defined as
%   K = exp (BETA * L), where L is graph lapalcian matrix and exp is matrix
%   exponential, which is calucalted by SVD.
%
%   See also: laplacian.
