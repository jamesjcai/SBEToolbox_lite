%In order to measure the centrality of the selected set of genes, the
%excess retention (ER) of the differentially expressed genes was calculated
%for each k-core. ER is a measure of the degree to which proteins from a
%particular group are represented relative to the entire protein network.
%The detailed explanation of ER has been described elsewhere (Wuchty and
%Almaas, 2005).
