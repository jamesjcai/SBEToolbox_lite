% Inputs:
%   connectMatrix: connectivity matrix of all the nodes, where at v(i,j) =
%       v(j,i) position and has distance between nodes i and j, size N by N
%       all positions in the matrix must be >= 0, also, all nodes need to be
%       interconnected (there exists a path from any one to any other node)
%   condOrRes: conductance or resistance, default cond, equal to 1
% Outputs:
%   nodesI: current through every node, size N by 1
%
% stamp the matrix of Resistors (only needs to be done once)
% matrix of resistaors, size same as connectMatrix
